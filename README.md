[Original official Torch gvnn ](https://github.com/ankurhanda/gvnn)


# What is gvnn?
gvnn is primarily intended for self-supervised learning using low-level vision. It is inspired by the Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) paper that appeared in NIPS in 2015 and its open source code made available by Maxime Oquab. The code is self contained i.e. the original implementation of STN by Maxime is also within the repository.
